Wow! I finally did it :sunglasses::metal:.

Anyone reading this please know that this blog is after a long period of procrastination. I've taken too much time to finish this one blog. For more information, I've been telling people about this project since 2018. Any time I thought about this it was like this:

Another great news for the reader, I dont know how to say this but you've entered a very boring place. If you're someone who has a life this might not be the place for you because most things that I might write about here is just plain boring.

So, if you're still reading well great either you're from my family, work or know me somehow and might be trying to figure what do I do on weekends or when I'm bored.

To give you an idea this blog is pretty much gonna be about tech stuff, me doing weird stuff and my personal opinion about things that I don't generally express.

I don't expect a lot of people reading this blog so if you're here then best of luck :confused:. I hope you'll stick around.

Me generally after today:
